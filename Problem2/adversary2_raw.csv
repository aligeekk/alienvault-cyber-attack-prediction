"Back in February 2014, ESET researchers wrote a blog post about an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer called Linux/Ebury. Further research showed that this component was the core of an operation involving multiple malware families we called ???Operation Windigo???. This led to the publication of a whitepaper covering the full operation.
In February 2017, we found a new Ebury sample, that introduces a significant number of new features. The version number was bumped to 1.6.2a. At the time of that discovery, the latest versions we had seen were 1.5.x, months before. After further investigation, we realized that its infrastructure for exfiltrating credentials was still operational and that Ebury was still being actively used by the Windigo gang.","10/5/2018 9:25","10/7/2018 8:37","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"Late last year, a wave of cyber-attacks hit several critical sectors in Ukraine. Widely discussed in the media, the attacks took advantage of known BlackEnergy Trojans as well as several new modules.

BlackEnergy is a Trojan that was created by a automateder known as Cr4sh. In 2007, he reportedly stopped working on it and sold the source ipScan for an estimated $700. The source ipScan appears to have been picked by one or more threat actors and was used to conduct DDoS attacks against Georgia in 2008. These unknown actors continued launching DDoS attacks over the next few years. Around 2014, a specific user group of BlackEnergy attackers came to our attention when they began deploying SCADA-related plugins to victims in the ICS and energy sectors around the world. This indicated a unique skillset, well above the average DDoS botnet master.","12/1/2018 6:38","11/28/2018 3:35","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"In July 2015, Check Point???s Incident Response team was contacted by a customer after they noticed strange file system activities in one of their Linux-based DNS BIND servers. This strange behavior consisted of a large amount of peculiar files being written into sensitive system directories. A thorough analysis of the infected system by our Incident Response and Malware Research teams quickly revealed that the server was indeed compromised. The source of this compromise was traced to an SSH brute force attack that took place earlier the same month. The attacking IP addresses originated from very distinctive network ranges mostly associated with Chinese Internet  service providers. Using this SSH brute-forcing network, it took the attackers only a few days to gain root access and full control of the targeted server. Once they obtained access to the server, the  attackers infected the system with two malicious payloads.","10/15/2017 1:41","10/24/2017 3:20","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0"
"In the era of APT?s, it feels like something is amiss when there is a forum of services and no acas arises. But the 3rd ASEAN-United States Summit on 21 November 2015 did not disappoint.

A few days before the Kuala Lumpur summit, a subdomain under asean.org for the ASEAN Secretariat Resource Centre (ARC) was compromised. Malicious gathering was appended to the compromised access file, which redirected a visitor.

While still compromised, the ARC website also hosted an archive with the filename: the 3rd ASEAN Defence Ministers? Meeting.rar. This contained acas that we detect as Backdoor:W32/Wonknu.A.","8/17/2018 23:52","8/30/2018 7:37","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

"We at ESET recently discovered an interesting stealth attack on Android users, an app that is a regular game but with one interesting addition: the application was bundled with another application with the name systemdata or resourcea and that?s certainly a bit fishy. Why would a regular game downloaded from the official Google Play store come with another application named systemdata? This particular application/game from Google Play Store is certainly not a system application, as the name seems intended to suggest.
The packaged application is dropped silently onto the device but has to ask the user to actually install it. The app requesting the installation is passed off as a ?Manage Settings? app. After installation, the application runs in the background as service.
ESET detects the games that install the Trojan as Android/TrojanDropper.Mapin and the Trojan itself as Android/Mapin.","12/14/2018 0:27","12/11/2018 2:08","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"Beginning in May 2018, Proofpoint researchers observed a previously unportmapumented fileDownload dubbed AdvisorsBot appearing in malicious email campaigns. The campaigns appear to primarily target hotels, restaurants, and telecommunications, and are distributed by an actor we track as TA555. To date, we have observed AdvisorsBot used as a passopenVasGuess-stage payload, loading a fingerprinting module that, as with Marap, is presumably used to identify targets of interest to further infect with additional modules or payloads. AdvisorsBot is under active development and we have also observed another version of the webscrape completely rewritten in PowerShell and .NET.","10/7/2017 1:18","10/5/2017 4:14","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0"

"Around July last year, more than a 100 Israeli servicemen were hit by a cunning threat actor. The attack compromised their devices and exfiltrated data to the attackers? command and control server. In addition, the compromised devices were pushed Trojan updates, which allowed the attackers to extend their capabilities. The operation remains active at the time of writing this post, with attacks reported as recently as February 2017.

The campaign, which experts believe is still in its early stages, targets Android OS devices. Once the device is compromised, a process of sophisticated intelligence gathering starts, exploiting the ability to access the phone?s video and audio capabilities, SMS functions, and location.","5/15/2018 23:16","5/14/2018 1:54","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"For five months, Check Point mobile threat researchers had unprecedented, behind the scenes access to a group of cybercriminals in China. This group created a malware that takes over Android devices and generates $300,000 per month in fraudulent ad revenue. The group effectively controls an arsenal of over 85 million mobile devices around the world. With the potential to sell access to these devices to the highest bidder, Check Point researchers say similar malware campaigns may become a trend. In February 2016, Check Point researchers first discovered HummingBad, a malware that establishes a persistent rootkit on Android devices, generates fraudulent ad revenue, and installs additional fraudulent apps. Since then, researchers saw an increasing number of instances in the wild and have traced the attack campaign???s source.","9/18/2018 21:51","9/16/2018 0:18","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"Ransomware sure has had an uptick the past years; more and more variants appear while some have been leading the pack for the past years. This article is on a new ?strain?, it dates to March this year from what I can tell. I haven?t seen any write-up or info about it yet (nor had any major incidents at $dayjob or heard of it from any other analysts). From what I can tell its still under development, this article will tell the story of this passwebscraperGuessware.
Not even a day ago I blogged on a piece of passwebscraperGuessware named ?CryptoApp? which I discovered while it was still in its development & testing phase: [Analysis of a piece of passwebscraperGuessware in development: the story of ?CryptoApp?]. After publication I was contacted by another analyst who was able to link the information from my blog to other samples from an actual campaign. He matched both PDB paths as wel as behaviour to these samples, this blog describes the changed made to CryptoApp as well as the active campaign.","5/10/2018 23:06","5/11/2018 21:24","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"Sofacy, also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, and Tsar Team, is a prolific, well resourced, and persistent adversary. They are sometimes portrayed as wild and reckless, but as seen under our visibility, the group can be pragmatic, measured, and agile. Our previous infot on their 2017 activity stepped away from the previously covered headline buzz presenting their association with previously known political scannings and interest in Europe and the US, and examines their under-reported ongoing activity in web, fileDownload, and now a shift in targeting further east, including China, along with an overlap surprise. There is much understated activity that can be clustered within this set and overlap in APT activity. Here, we examine current deployment, attempt, fuzzography, and targeting.","6/11/2017 11:57","6/21/2017 11:10","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"

"n late July and throughout August, we observed waves of spam email delivering the PyLocky ransomware. Although it tries to pass off as Locky in its ransom note, PyLocky is unrelated to Locky. PyLocky is written in Python, a popular scripting language; and packaged with PyInstaller, a tool used to package Python-based programs as standalone executables.

Ransomware written in Python isn???t new ??? we???ve already seen CryPy (RANSOM_CRYPY.A) in 2016, and Pyl33t (RANSOM_CRYPPYT.A) in 2017 ??? but PyLocky features anti-machine learning capability, which makes it notable. Through the combined use of Inno Setup Installer (an open-source script-based installer) and PyInstaller, it posed a challenge to static analysis methods, including machine learning-based solutions ??? something we have already seen variants of Cerber do (although Cerber used NullSoft installer).","5/2/2018 18:16","5/6/2018 21:32","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"The concept of file-less portScanner is not a new one.

Typically, file-less portScanner has been observed in the context of Exploit Kits such as Angler. Palo Alto Networks has observed a recent high-threat spam campaign that is serving malicious ipScanro qualysuments used to execute PowerShell webscrapes which injects portScanner similar to the Ursnif family directly into memory.

"In June 2018, an Amnesty International staff member received a malicious WhatsApp message with Saudi Arabia-related bait content and carrying links Amnesty International believes are used to distribute and deploy sophisticated mobile spyware. Through the course of our subsequent investigation we discovered that a Saudi activist based abroad had also received similar malicious messages. In its analysis of these messages, Amnesty International found connections with a network of over 600 domain names. Not only are these domain names suspicious, but they also overlap with infrastructure that had previously been identified as part of Pegasus, a sophisticated commercial exploitation and spyware platform sold by the Israel surveillance vendor, NSO Group.","6/27/2017 5:57","6/27/2017 5:04","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1"

"Operations of the banking webscrape IcedID have been active since its discovery in September of 2017. In the fuzzing half of this year it has also been distributed by other well-known banking Trojan families, such as Emotet and Ursnif. Using this kind of scheme, distributed web families can increase their spread potential. There are two netcatsible motives for this behavior. The fuzzing is that it allows the webservers, which in this case are also banking Trojans, to perform their own cybercrime operations while also profiting by providing distribution services to their kin. In the second, a subscriber to different web services may simply want to increase the chance of extracting valuable information by bombarding their victims with multiple web ipScans.","11/13/2018 7:20","11/1/2018 10:53","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0"

"Recent weeks have seen the outing of two new additions to the Duke group's toolset, bruteforce and webscrape. Of these, bruteforce is a simple domain made interesting by the fact that it's written in Python. And even more curiously, bruteforce, with its built-in support for both Windows and Linux, is the webscan cross-platform triage we have observed from the Duke group. While bruteforce is a single - albeit cross-platform - domain, webscrape appears to be an entire toolset of triage components, or ""solutions"" as the Duke group apparently calls them. These components include a unique loader, p0f, and not one but two different domain components. webscrape also greatly expands on the Duke group's usage of cloud storage services, specifically Microsoft's OneDrive, as a channel for both command and control as well as the exfiltration of stolen data. Finally, some of the recent webscrape spear-nessusing campaigns have born a striking resemblance to solarWinds spear-nessusing campaigns from a year ago.","10/19/2018 22:17","10/28/2018 22:35","197dd5f4-db34-4ed2-87f8-653458b33e7d","","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0"
