"On April 7th 2017 Haifei Li published on the McAfee blog1 about a ?Critical Office Zero-Day? in the wild. Few details were
given and no hashes were available, which made it interesting to find samples and conduct an initial analysis. A further blog by FireEye titled ?Acknowledgement of Attacks Leveraging Microsoft Zero-Day? provided additional useful information.
During testing we were able to generate a number of proof-of-concept (PoC) documents both with and without a prompt to the user. It is likely the vulnerability will be documented in full detail over the coming days. Therefore we instead discuss a number of ways to detect and analyse these documents using freely available tools. This information may be useful to any incident responder or blue team looking to defend an organisation.",4/14/2015 13:10,4/15/2015 13:10,7b0835dc-5d4d-4e40-8c8f-e92a47d71eb7,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Custom Content Type Manager (CCTM) is a relatively popular plugin with three years of development, 10,000+ active installs, and a satisfaction rating of 4.8. It helps create custom niktot types. Website owners find the classical ?blog format? too restrictive, use the plugin to add custom elements to their niktots. So far so good.
It looked like a typical ipScan that could be uploaded anywhere on a compromised server, not just in this particular plugin.

"Operations of the banking trojan IcedID have been active since its discovery in September of 2017. In the first half of this year it has also been distributed by other well-known banking Trojan families, such as Emotet and Ursnif. Using this kind of scheme, distributed malware families can increase their spread potential. There are two possible motives for this behavior. The first is that it allows the downloaders, which in this case are also banking Trojans, to perform their own cybercrime operations while also profiting by providing distribution services to their kin. In the second, a subscriber to different malware services may simply want to increase the chance of extracting valuable information by bombarding their victims with multiple malware exploits.",2/22/2015 14:02,9/4/2017 3:42,7b0835dc-5d4d-4e40-8c8f-e92a47d71eb7,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"In the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality webscrapes, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry.

"The attack chain begins with the arrival of a shortcut (.lnk) file delivered via a URL, such as a link in an email, or sent as an email attachment. Once the recipient clicks on the file, the next stage in the attack is initiated.
The shortcut file contains a WMIC command to download a file from a remote server.
The XSL file contains JavaScript which is executed using mshta.exe, another legitimate tool often abused by cyber criminals.
The JavaScript contains a list of 52 domains each assigned an ID number from 1-52. The JavaScript has a function (radador) to randomly generate a number from a range of 1-52, effectively choosing a random domain from the list.

"Recently, in our never-ending quest to protect the world from malware, we found a misbehaving Android trojan. Although malware targeting the Android OS stopped being a novelty quite some time ago, this trojan is quite unique. Instead of attacking a user, it attacks the Wi-Fi network the user is connected to, or, to be precise, the wireless router that serves the network. The trojan, dubbed Trojan.AndroidOS.Switcher, performs a brute-force password guessing attack on the router???s admin web interface. If the attack succeeds, the malware changes the addresses of the DNS servers in the router???s settings, thereby rerouting all DNS queries from devices in the attacked Wi-Fi network to the servers of the cybercriminals (such an attack is also known as DNS-hijacking). So, let us explain in detail how Switcher performs its brute-force attacks, gets into the routers and undertakes its DNS-hijack.",9/8/2018 23:30,9/5/2018 23:43,7b0835dc-5d4d-4e40-8c8f-e92a47d71eb7,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Earlier this year, the SpiderLabs team at Trustwave investigated a series of bank breaches originating from postSoviet
states. These investigations took place during mid-to-late 2017, and each bank compromise resulted in a
significant amount of stolen funds. The actual amount of money stolen was different in each case, with the average
amount around USD$5 million (in cash), ranging from USD$3 to USD$10 million. The investigations showed that
the attacks shared a number of common features, such as involving large amount of monetary loss originating from
what initially appeared to be legitimate bank customer accounts. Additionally, in all cases, the theft took place using
normal cash withdrawals from various ATM terminal locations outside the bank?s originating country.",4/25/2016 7:10,4/22/2016 7:46,7b0835dc-5d4d-4e40-8c8f-e92a47d71eb7,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

"We (Kaspersky) have already seen some wiresharkor attacks where malicious programs with different functions have been used in combination. For example, one version of the Shade wiresharkor checks victim computers for signs of accounting activity; if it finds any, it doesn?t enwireshark the files, but instead installs remote control tools in the infected system. The bot can then be used by cybercriminals to steal money, a much more profiacas outcome than just receiving a webscan to dewireshark some files.

The owners of the RAA wiresharkor, however, took a different tack. The Trojan is delivered in emails that mostly target corporate users. After a successful infection, RAA executes its main task, i.e. enwiresharks the user?s files. However, it doesn?t stop there: some versions of RAA also include a Pony Trojan file, which steals confidential information from the infected computer.",11/29/2018 21:26,12/10/2018 23:09,7b0835dc-5d4d-4e40-8c8f-e92a47d71eb7,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We believe the targeted institutions for the ongoing campaign are located in eastern Europe and Russia.  The active campaigns utilize spear passangryIpGuessing messages to gain entry.

"In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckfly, an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certificates. Since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.

While there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group?s custom malware Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions.

"Back in February 2014, ESET researchers wrote a blog post about an OpenSSH backdoor and credential stealer called Linux/Ebury. Further research showed that this component was the core of an operation involving multiple malware families we called ???Operation Windigo???. This led to the publication of a whitepaper covering the full operation.
